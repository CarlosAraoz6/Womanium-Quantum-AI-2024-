    "### 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson equation is a fundamental partial differential equation (PDE) that describes potential distribution in static fields, making it crucial for various applications in science and engineering, including heat conduction, fluid dynamics, electrostatics, semiconductor physics, optics, and mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson equation also plays a crucial role in modeling various phenomena related to weather, climate, geophysical systems, and clean energy. One notable application is in the simulation of groundwater flow, which is essential for understanding aquifer behavior, managing water resources, and predicting the impacts of climate change on water availability. Groundwater models often rely on the Poisson equation to describe the potential flow of water through porous media, allowing researchers to predict changes in groundwater levels and assess the sustainability of water extraction practices [1][2].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In atmospheric science, the Poisson equation is used to model electrostatic potentials, aiding in the understanding and prediction of weather patterns, including storm formation and pollutant distribution [3]. In the context of clean energy, the Poisson equation is instrumental in modeling the behavior of photovoltaic cells, particularly in simulating the electric potential distribution within the semiconductor material. This is crucial for optimizing the efficiency of solar cells and developing new materials for more effective energy conversion [4][5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Poisson equation is applied in carbon sequestration studies, helping to model CO2 injection and migration in geological formations. Accurate modeling of these processes is essential for designing effective carbon emission mitigation strategies [6][7].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively solving the Poisson equation is important due to its broad range of applications and significant impact on various fields. By solving the Poisson equation using advanced computational techniques, we aim to contribute to better resource management, improved weather prediction, optimized clean energy solutions, and effective climate change mitigation. This project is not only scientifically challenging but also offers practical benefits that align with my interests and the overarching goals of the Womanium Quantum+AI 2024 Hackathon.\n",

    "### 2. Classical Methods for Solving the Poisson Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical methods for solving the Poisson equation have been extensively studied and implemented across various fields of science and engineering. These methos include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Difference Method (FDM):\n",
    "The FDM approximates the derivatives in the Poisson equation using difference equations, converting the PDE into a system of algebraic equations. This method is straightforward to implement and is effective for problems with simple geometries and boundary conditions. However, it can become computationally intensive for large-scale problems due to the increase in the number of grid points required for accurate solutions [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Element Method (FEM):\n",
    "The FEM divides the domain into smaller sub-domains (elements) and uses test functions to convert the PDE into a system of algebraic equations. This method is highly versatile and can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions more effectively than FDM. It requires more sophisticated implementation and higher computational resources [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "Multigrid Methods:\n",
    "Multigrid methods accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers for large linear systems arising from discretized PDEs. These methods solve the problem on a hierarchy of grids, transferring information between coarse and fine grids to enhance efficiency. They have fast convergence, which is efficient for large-scale problems but they have complex implementations that require careful tuning of parameters [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Methods:\n",
    "Spectral methods represent the solution to the Poisson equation as a sum of basis functions (e.g., Fourier or Chebyshev polynomials) and solve for the coefficients of these functions. These methods are highly accurate for problems with smooth solutions but can struggle with complex geometries and discontinuities [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the Poisson equation efficiently is essential for accelerating developments that rely on computer simulations and real-world experiments. However, conventional methods for solving the Poisson equation demand significant computational resources and encounter exponential growth in computational complexity as the problem size increases. Therefore, exploring new approaches such as quantum computing and AI/ML techniques to solve the Poisson equation is crucial for advancing these fields.\n"

    "## 3.  AI/ML and quantum computing techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "While classical methods remain foundational, the integration of AI/ML and quantum computing techniques offers promising new avenues for solving the Poisson equation more efficiently, particularly for large-scale and complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, alternative approaches leveraging AI/ML and quantum computing techniques have been explored to address these challenges. Quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach to significantly reduce the computational costs of solving PDEs, including the Poisson equation [12]. The study of using quantum computers to solve Poisson equations in gate insulators demonstrated the potential of quantum methods in semiconductor physics. This study used quantum simulations to analyze gate insulators, highlighting the benefits of quantum parallelism in solving PDEs [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some significant attempts to solve the Poisson equation using quantum methods include the implementation of the Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving the Poisson equation on quantum simulators. The HHL algorithm is designed to solve systems of linear equations exponentially faster than classical algorithms under certain conditions. The algorithm works by encoding the problem into a quantum state, applying a sequence of quantum operations (including the Quantum Fourier Transform), and then decoding the result to obtain the solution. For the Poisson equation, this involves discretizing the equation, representing the resulting linear system in a sparse matrix form, and using HHL to solve it. This approach has shown promise in reducing the computational complexity but requires significant quantum resources, such as qubits and coherence time, which are challenging to maintain with current quantum hardware [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving the Poisson equation. They are hybrid algorithms that leverage both quantum and classical computing resources. VQAs involve preparing a parameterized quantum state, evaluating a cost function (which could be related to the energy or potential), and using classical optimization techniques to iteratively adjust the parameters to minimize the cost function. Notable examples include the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which have been successfully applied to various optimization problems and quantum simulations. Liu et al. demonstrated a VQA for solving the Poisson equation by decomposing the sparse Hamiltonian of the discretized equation and efficiently computing the expectation values required for the optimization [15]. This approach takes advantage of the quantum computer's ability to represent and manipulate complex quantum states, potentially offering a significant computational speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cao et al. developed an algorithm for solving the Poisson equation [16], these quantum algorithms aim to provide faster and more efficient solutions compared to classical methods. Although it is widely believed that these quantum algorithms will demonstrate quantum supremacy once fault-tolerant quantum computers with sufficient qubits and error correction techniques are ready, it is expected to be a long time until such a quantum computer can be realized. Consequently, recent interest in quantum computing has focused on the development of quantum algorithms that perform meaningful computations with a small number of qubits and shallow circuits. In other words, it is important to construct a quantum algorithm that can be implemented on so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable approach is the variational quantum algorithm developed by Sato et al. for solving the Poisson equation [17]. This algorithm defines the total potential energy of the Poisson equation as an expectation of certain observables, which are decomposed into a linear combination of Pauli operators and simple observables. The expectation value of these observables is then minimized with respect to a parameterized quantum state. Because the number of decomposed terms is independent of the size of the problem, this method requires relatively few quantum measurements. Numerical experiments demonstrate the faster computing speed of this method compared with classical computing methods and a previous variational quantum approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these approaches offers distinct advantages and disadvantages. Classical methods, such as the Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Multigrid Methods, and Spectral Methods, are well-understood and can be implemented on existing high-performance computing infrastructure. However, they struggle with scalability and computational efficiency for large problems. Quantum algorithms, such as HHL and VQAs, offer the potential for significant speedups and efficient handling of large-scale problems. However, they are currently limited by hardware constraints, such as the number of qubits and error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing these quantum algorithms requires access to quantum computing hardware, such as IBM's quantum computers or other NISQ devices. The computational resources needed include a sufficient number of qubits to represent the problem and the ability to perform complex quantum operations with minimal error rates. Additionally, classical optimization techniques are necessary to iteratively adjust the parameters in VQAs, which involves significant classical computing resources.\n",

    "### Analysis of Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of the quantum circuit designed to solve the Poisson equation using the HHL algorithm resulted in the following counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Counts: {'1': 2082, '0': 6114}\n",
    "\n",
    "These counts indicate the frequency of measuring the ancillary qubit in states 0 and 1 across 8196 shots (executions) of the circuit. Specifically, the ancillary qubit was measured in state 0 in 6114 shots and in state 1 in 2082 shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of using the HHL algorithm is to find the solution to the matrix equation $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ represents the Laplacian operator and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the source vector. The resulting vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is the potential we seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "High Probability of Ancillary Qubit in State 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ancillary qubit being in state 0 for 6114 out of 8196 shots (~75%) indicates that the HHL algorithm has likely produced a solution close to the correct result. The higher frequency of state 0 is expected because it aligns with the theoretical solution where the potential vector $\\mathbf{x}$ should be close to the desired state, causing the phase estimation and subsequent operations to reflect a higher likelihood of measuring 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement of State 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement of state 1 in 2082 shots (~25%) suggests some noise or error in the implementation or the inherent noise in the quantum simulator. This is consistent with the addition of a noise model in the simulation, which includes depolarizing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Noise and Errors \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation included a depolarizing error model to account for realistic quantum noise. The results reflect how noise can affect the accuracy of quantum computations. Despite the noise, the algorithm shows a strong bias towards the correct solution, as indicated by the higher count for state 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The implementation of the HHL algorithm to solve the Poisson equation in a quantum simulator has shown promising results. The higher count for the ancillary qubit being in state 0 demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the solution to the matrix equation $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectiveness: The results validate the theoretical foundations of the HHL algorithm, showing a strong likelihood of producing the correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise Impact: The presence of noise in the simulation slightly affected the results, as indicated by the measurements of state 1. However, the algorithm still predominantly yielded the expected state 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing advanced error mitigation techniques can further reduce the impact of noise and improve the accuracy of the results. Scaling the algorithm to more qubits can help address larger and more complex Poisson equations. Running the algorithm on actual quantum hardware can provide insights into practical challenges and real-world applicability. With these further refinements of the quantum circuit the accuracy and relianility of the results could improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of quantum algorithms in solving complex partial differential equations like the Poisson equation, paving the way for more advanced quantum computing applications in scientific and engineering domains.\n"
